# QAT Artifacts Repository

This repository hosts **public artifacts** from QA Automation Tool test runs.

## Purpose

While the main QA automation code is private ([qa-automation-tool](https://github.com/rsmedstad/qa-automation-tool) - restricted access), this repository provides **public access** to:
- Test execution summaries (`summary.json`)
- Test results (Excel files)
- Run metadata and links
- Historical test run data

**No GitHub authentication required** - accessible by all team members.

## Structure

```
/runs
  /{run-id}/
    - summary.json      # Test execution summary
    - results-{id}.xlsx # Detailed test results
    - metadata.json     # Links to media files
    - README.md         # Run-specific documentation
```

## Accessing Media Files

Screenshots and videos are stored in Azure Blob Storage for efficiency.
Check the `metadata.json` file in each run directory for access URLs.

## Data Retention

Artifacts older than 60 days may be automatically cleaned up.
