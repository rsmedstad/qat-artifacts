# QAT Artifacts Repository

This repository hosts public artifacts from QA Automation Tool test runs.

## Purpose

While the main QA automation code remains private, this repository provides:
- Test execution summaries
- Test results (Excel files)
- Metadata for accessing media files
- Historical test run data

## Structure

```
/runs
  /{run-id}/
    - summary.json      # Test execution summary
    - results-{id}.xlsx # Detailed test results
    - metadata.json     # Links to media files
    - README.md         # Run-specific documentation
```

## Accessing Media Files

Screenshots and videos are stored in Azure Blob Storage for efficiency.
Check the `metadata.json` file in each run directory for access URLs.

## Data Retention

Artifacts older than 60 days may be automatically cleaned up.
